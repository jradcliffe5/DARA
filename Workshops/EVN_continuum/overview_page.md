## EVN Continuum

The EVN continuum tutorial is split into three parts which should be done in order.

* All the scripts for this tutorial can be found [here](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~radcliff/DARA/Data_reduction_workshops/EVN_Continuum/NME_DARA.tgz) and please see the README file)

* The data can be downloaded from here: [data link](http://www.jive.nl/fitsfiles?experiment=N14C3_141022)

The webpages to guide you through the tutorials are below:

  1. [CASA Basic Calibration](part1/part1_initial_cal.md) - initial calibration of data set with two pairs of phase-ref and target.
  2. [CASA_1848+283_J1849+3024](part2/part2_script_cal.md) - guide to script-based calibration and imaging of J1849+3024.
  3. [CASA_J1640+3946_3C345](part3/part3_imaging.md) - guide to problem-solving script-based calibration and imaging of 3C345.

**NOTE** Part 1.should provide the starting files for parts 2. & 3. but if necessary you can download the data which has been already partially calibrated

* For stage 2, download [1848+283_J1849+3024.ms.tgz](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~radcliff/DARA/Data_reduction_workshops/EVN_Continuum/1848+283_J1849+3024.ms.tgz)
* For stage 3, download [J1640+3946_3C345.ms.tgz](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~radcliff/DARA/Data_reduction_workshops/EVN_Continuum/J1640+3946_3C345.ms.tgz)

You can unpack the tgz files using the UNIX command `tar` e.g. `tar -xvf NME_DARA.tgz` will unpack the files in a directory in your current area called NME_DARA.tgz
