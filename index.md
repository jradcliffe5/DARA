# Welcome to the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy (DARA) Unit 4 Repository

This page is designed to be a replacement for the old Unit 4 website ([see here](http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~radcliff/DARA/index.html)) so that we can easily flag issues with materials taught in this unit

**IMPORTANT: website is still under construction therefore dead links are expected and some are patched towards the old website**

## Information on DARA
Manchester is playing a leading role in the future long-term development of the SKA by training the next generation of African students who will run telescopes of the SKA2 in 8 countries. The DARA (Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy) initiative is within the UK Newton project and is coordinated with South Africa. DARA is headed by Professor Melvin Hoare (Leeds), Professor Peter Wilkinson, Dr. Robert Beswick (Manchester), Professor Michael Jones, Professor Matthew Jarvis (Oxford), Professor Martin Hardcastle, Dr. Mark Thompson (Hertfordshire) together with Dr. Roelf Botha (HartRAO; South Africa). Other members of JBCA are now taking leading roles in the training and have recently returned from their first training sessions in Kenya and Zambia.
This website consolidates teaching materials used in data processing schools. For an overview of DARA as a whole please see the main DARA [website](https://www.dara-project.org)
